# ML Progress

## Day 1: NumPy Fundamentals

**Date**: 18 sep  
**File**: `1Numpy.ipynb`

### What I Learned Today:

- **NumPy Basics**: Array creation, properties (shape, dtype, size), and indexing
- **Array Operations**: Slicing, boolean masking, and fancy indexing
- **Mathematical Operations**: Element wise operations, linear algebra (matrix multiplication, determinants)
- **Statistical Functions**: min, max, sum with axis operations
- **Array Manipulation**: Reshaping, stacking, copying vs references

### Key Functions Practiced:

np.array(), np.zeros(), np.ones(), np.random.randint()
np.matmul(), np.linalg.det(), np.vstack(), np.hstack()
.reshape(), .copy(), boolean operations (&, |, ~)

## Kaggle Learn â€“ Intro to Machine Learning
**File**: `Intro to Machine Learning Kaggle`

I completed the entire [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) course on Kaggle.  
Here are the lessons I worked through (with links to my notebooks):

1. [How Models Work](https://www.kaggle.com/yourusername/how-models-work)
2. [Basic Data Exploration](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anirudh4v/exercise-explore-your-data)
3. [Your First Machine Learning Model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anirudh4v/exercise-your-first-machine-learning-model)
4. [Model Validation](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anirudh4v/exercise-model-validation)
5. [Underfitting and Overfitting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anirudh4v/exercise-underfitting-and-overfitting)
6. [Random Forests](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anirudh4v/exercise-random-forests)
7. [Machine Learning Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anirudh4v/exercise-machine-learning-competitions)
